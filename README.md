### Link notebook: [Click Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13vzwySevIgYA3CqUvMOiClEsEc1CFPoA?usp=sharing)


The structure of this branch is quite straightforward:

- `dataset` folder: processing all modules related to dataset (dataloader, preprocessing)

- `models` folder: architecture of each model we used in the notebook

- `utils` and `auxiliary` folder: supporting functions for all modules in this repo.
